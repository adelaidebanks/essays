OTHELLO </br>
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! </br>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. </br>
Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago, </br>
All my fond love thus do ***I blow to heaven.*** </br>
’Tis gone. </br>
Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell! </br>
***Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne*** </br>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, </br>
For ’tis of ***[aspics’ tongues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asp_(snake)https://)! ***</br>
<small style="border: 5px solid red;" >Othello is beginning to believe the seeds of doubt Iago is planting in his
    mind about Desdemona's faithfulness </small> 
    
IAGO  Yet be content. </br>
OTHELLO </br>
O, **blood, blood, blood!** </br>
IAGO </br>
Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change. </br>
<small style="border: 5px solid red;" >Iago is pretending to have faith in Desdemona so it will seem more consequential when he does accuse her of cheating therefore manipulating Othello to trust him further</small>

OTHELLO </br>
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, </br>
Whose icy current and compulsive course </br>
**Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on*** </br>
To the ==Propontic=={Q35367} and [the Hellespont](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/public/glossary.aspx?id=21722), </br>
Even so my **bloody** thoughts, with violent pace </br>
Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love, </br>
Till that a capable and wide revenge </br>

Swallow them up. He kneels. Now by yond marble </br>
heaven, </br>
In the due reverence of a **sacred vow,** </br>
I here engage my words. </br>
IAGO  
Do not rise yet. Iago kneels. </br>
Witness, you ***ever-burning lights above,*** </br>
You elements that clip us round about, </br>
Witness that here Iago doth give up </br>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart </br>
To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command, </br>
And to obey shall be in me remorse, </br>
What **bloody** business ever. They rise. </br>
OTHELLO  
I greet thy love </br>
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance </br>
bounteous, </br>
And will upon the instant put thee to ’t. </br>
Within these three days let me hear thee say </br>
That ==Cassio’s=={Q6829164} not alive. </br>
IAGO  
My friend is dead. </br>

’Tis done at your request. **But let her live.** </br>
OTHELLO  
Damn her, lewd [minx](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minx)! O, damn her, damn </br>
her! </br>
Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw </br>
To furnish me with some swift means of death </br>
For the **fair devil.** Now art thou my lieutenant. </br>
IAGO  
I am your own forever. </br>
They exit. </br>
