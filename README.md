 
OTHELLO </br>
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! </br>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. </br>
Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago, </br>
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. </br>
’Tis gone. </br>
Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell! </br>
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne </br>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, </br>
For ’tis of aspics’ tongues! </br>
IAGO  Yet be content. </br>
OTHELLO  O, blood, blood, blood! </br>
IAGO </br>
Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change. </br>
OTHELLO </br>
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, </br>
Whose icy current and compulsive course </br>
Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on </br>
To the Propontic and the Hellespont, </br>
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace </br>
Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love, </br>
Till that a capable and wide revenge </br>
Swallow them up. He kneels. Now by yond marble </br>
heaven, </br>
In the due reverence of a sacred vow, </br>
I here engage my words. </br>
IAGO  Do not rise yet.Iago kneels. </br>
Witness, you ever-burning lights above, </br>
You elements that clip us round about, </br>
Witness that here Iago doth give up </br>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart </br>
To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command, </br>
And to obey shall be in me remorse, </br>
What bloody business ever.They rise. </br>
OTHELLO  I greet thy love </br>
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance </br>
bounteous, </br>
And will upon the instant put thee to ’t. </br>
Within these three days let me hear thee say </br>
That Cassio’s not alive. </br>
IAGO  My friend is dead. </br>
’Tis done at your request. But let her live. </br>
OTHELLO  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn </br>
her! </br>
Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw </br>
To furnish me with some swift means of death </br>
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. </br>
IAGO  I am your own forever. </br>
They exit. </br>
